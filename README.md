# Sales Summary Demo

This is a simple single-page web application that demonstrates fetching and processing data from a CSV file.

## Features

- Fetches sales data from an embedded CSV string.
- Calculates the sum of the 'sales' column.
- Displays the total sales on the page.
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for styling.

## How it works

The `index.html` file contains an embedded CSV string representing the sales data. Upon page load, the JavaScript code parses this CSV, sums the sales figures, and updates the `#total-sales` element with the calculated total.
